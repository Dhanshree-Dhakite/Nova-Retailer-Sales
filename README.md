Insights :-
1. Sales Are Rising, but Profit Growth Is Lagging
Total Sales: $3.43M from 15,031 orders

Total Profit: Only $450.8K, indicating a relatively low profit margin (~13%).

The Sales Trend (2015–2018) shows a strong increase in sales volume, especially in 2018, but profits haven’t grown at the same pace, hinting at rising costs or lower-margin products driving growth.

2. Returns Are Impacting Profitability
Return Rate: 4.01% of total orders.

Major return reasons:

Incorrect Product Ordered

Defective Items

Incorrect Product Shipped

High-return sub-categories include Binders, Chairs, Machines, and Phones, with machines (DYMO, Xerox) contributing high volume and low profit, potentially eroding margins.

3. Technology Category Drives Sales, but Profitability Varies by Sub-Category
Technology leads in both sales volume and profit among all categories.

Sub-categories like Phones and Machines show sales presence but have low or negative profits (red bars), indicating possible pricing or return issues.

On the other hand, Accessories and Appliances are profitable and should be emphasized more in campaigns.

4. Consumers Drive the Most Profit; Home Office Segment Lags
Consumer Segment generates the highest profit (~$230K), more than Corporate and Home Office.

The Home Office segment contributes least to profit, suggesting a need to revisit product-market fit or pricing strategy for this group.

5. West Region and Technology Sales Dominate; Focus Needed on Low-Performing Regions
West region leads in total sales (~$2M), while the South region lags significantly.

Shipping times are highest in the Central region (4.05 days), possibly impacting customer satisfaction.

Top profit-generating customers are skewed toward certain regions — efforts should be made to identify and nurture more such customers across underperforming regions.
